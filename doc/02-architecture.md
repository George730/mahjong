## 2. Technology Choices

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Frontend | React + TypeScript | Component model fits tile-based UI; strong ecosystem |
| State management | Zustand | Lightweight, sufficient for game state |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Rapid UI development, responsive utilities |
| Real-time transport | Socket.IO (WebSocket) | Reliable bidirectional communication with fallback |
| Voice chat | WebRTC (via PeerJS or simple-peer) | Peer-to-peer audio, low latency |
| Signaling server | Socket.IO (shared) | Reuse existing WebSocket connection for signaling |
| Backend | Node.js + Express | JS everywhere; fast iteration |
| Game engine | TypeScript (shared package) | Shared logic between client (validation) and server (authority) |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Relational model fits user/game/history data |
| Cache / pub-sub | Redis | Room state caching, cross-instance pub-sub |
| Auth | JWT + bcrypt | Stateless auth; simple guest tokens |
| Deployment | Docker + docker-compose → cloud | Reproducible environments |

## 4. Data Model

### 4.1 PostgreSQL Schema

```sql
-- Users
CREATE TABLE users (
    id            UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    username      VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    display_name  VARCHAR(100),
    created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at    TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Aggregate stats for registered users
CREATE TABLE user_stats (
    user_id       UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id),
    games_played  INT DEFAULT 0,
    games_won     INT DEFAULT 0,
    total_points  INT DEFAULT 0,
    highest_fan   INT DEFAULT 0,
    updated_at    TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Completed game records
CREATE TABLE games (
    id            UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    room_code     VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    variant       VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'normal',  -- normal | skill | cracked
    started_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    ended_at      TIMESTAMPTZ,
    rounds_played INT DEFAULT 0
);

-- Per-player results within a game
CREATE TABLE game_players (
    id          UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    game_id     UUID REFERENCES games(id),
    user_id     UUID REFERENCES users(id),  -- NULL for guests
    seat_wind   VARCHAR(5),                 -- E/S/W/N
    final_score INT DEFAULT 0,
    is_winner   BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    guest_name  VARCHAR(100)               -- display name for guests
);
```

### 4.2 Redis Keys

| Key Pattern | Type | Purpose |
|-------------|------|---------|
| `room:{code}` | Hash | Room metadata (host, players, status) |
| `room:{code}:game` | String (JSON) | Serialized live game state |
| `room:{code}:chat` | List | Recent chat messages |

---

## 5. Real-Time Communication Protocol

All game events flow over Socket.IO. The server is the **single source of truth**; clients send intents, the server validates and broadcasts state updates.

### Key Events

| Direction | Event | Payload | Description |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| C→S | `room:create` | callback `{ ok, room }` | Create a new room (host gets East seat) |
| C→S | `room:join` | `roomCode`, callback `{ ok, room }` | Join existing room |
| C→S | `room:leave` | — | Leave current room |
| S→C | `room:updated` | `Room` | Broadcast updated room state to all players |
| S→C | `room:error` | `message` | Error message for the requesting client |
| S→C | `session:displaced` | — | Notifies a tab that a newer tab has taken over the session |
| C→S | `game:start` | — | Host starts the game |
| S→C | `game:state` | `{ hand, discards, melds, wallCount, turnPlayer, ... }` | Full/delta state update (each player only sees their own hand) |
| C→S | `game:discard` | `{ tileId }` | Discard a tile |
| C→S | `game:claim` | `{ action: 'chow'|'pung'|'kong'|'win', tiles[] }` | Claim a discard |
| S→C | `game:actionPrompt` | `{ availableActions[] }` | Prompt player for possible claims |
| S→C | `game:roundEnd` | `{ winner, scores, fanDetails[] }` | Round results |
| S→C | `game:end` | `{ finalScores[] }` | Game over |
| C↔S | `voice:signal` | WebRTC signaling data | SDP/ICE exchange |

---

## 6. Game Engine Design

The game engine lives in `packages/common` and is used by both server and client.

### 6.1 State Machine

```
WAITING → DEALING → PLAYING → ROUND_END → (next round or GAME_END)
                      ↑                          │
                      └──────────────────────────┘
```

### 6.2 Turn Flow (PLAYING state)

```
DRAW_TILE
  → Player receives tile
  → Check for self-drawn win (自摸)
  → If win: → ROUND_END
  → Else: player must DISCARD

DISCARD_TILE
  → Tile placed on table
  → Other players checked for claims (priority: Win > Kong > Pung > Chow)
  → If claim: execute claim → claimer's turn (or ROUND_END if win)
  → If no claim after timeout: next player's turn → DRAW_TILE

WALL_EXHAUSTED
  → ROUND_END (draw game / 流局)
```

### 6.3 Scoring Engine

- Implements all 81 fan patterns from the Chinese Official rulebook.
- Input: winning hand (tiles + melds), win condition (self-drawn vs discard), seat/round wind.
- Output: list of matched fan patterns + total fan count + point value.
- Exclusion principle applied (higher patterns exclude lower overlapping ones).

---

## 7. Voice Chat Architecture

- **WebRTC** mesh topology (4 players = 6 peer connections).
- Signaling via the existing Socket.IO connection — no separate signaling server needed.
- STUN server for NAT traversal (use public Google STUN or self-hosted).
- Optional TURN server for restrictive networks (coturn, self-hosted).
- Audio only — no video.

---

## 8. Security Considerations

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|-----------|
| Tile visibility | Server never sends other players' hidden tiles to a client (except in 破解版 probability data) |
| Claim validation | Server validates every claim against actual game state |
| Auth | JWT with short expiry + refresh tokens; bcrypt for passwords |
| Room access | Room codes are random, unguessable (nanoid, 6 chars uppercase alpha) |
| Multi-tab abuse | One active socket per user; duplicate tabs are displaced server-side |
| Rate limiting | Express rate-limit on HTTP; Socket.IO event throttling |
| Input sanitization | Validate all socket payloads with zod schemas |

---

## 9. Scalability Path

**Phase 1–4 (single instance)**:
- One Node.js process handles rooms, game logic, and signaling.
- PostgreSQL + Redis on same host or managed services.

**Phase 5+ (multi-instance)**:
- Redis pub-sub for cross-instance room events.
- Sticky sessions via Redis adapter for Socket.IO.
- Horizontal scaling behind a load balancer (nginx / cloud LB).
- Database connection pooling (pgBouncer).

---

## 10. Phase-by-Phase Architecture Notes

### Phase 1 — Foundation
- Express server with Socket.IO.
- Room CRUD in Redis (JSON serialized, 2hr TTL).
- JWT auth (register + guest mode); guest tokens via `/api/auth/guest`.
- React app with Lobby UI, room creation, join-via-link.
- **Session displacement**: server tracks one active socket per user (`userSocketMap`). New connections emit `session:displaced` to the old socket before disconnecting it.
- **Socket-keyed room tracking**: room membership is keyed by `socketId` (not `userId`) so a displaced socket's disconnect does not remove the user from their room.
- **Host = East**: room creator is always seat 0 (East). On host departure, the new host is reassigned to seat 0.
- **Self-highlighting**: the current player's seat in the lobby is highlighted with a distinct border and "You" label.

### Phase 2 — Core Game

#### 2A — Tile System
- `packages/common/src/tiles.ts` — tile enum (`Wan1`–`Wan9`, `Tiao1`–`Tiao9`, `Tong1`–`Tong9`, 4 winds, 3 dragons, 4 seasons, 4 flowers), tile metadata (suit, rank, category), unique tile ID type.
- `createFullSet()` — returns 144 tiles with correct distribution (4× each standard tile, 1× each season/flower).
- `shuffle(tiles)` — Fisher-Yates shuffle returning a new array.

#### 2B — Game State & Deal
- `packages/common/src/game-state.ts` — canonical `GameState` type: wall, hands (per player), discards (per player), melds (per player), current turn, round wind, dealer, state machine phase.
- State machine: `WAITING → DEALING → PLAYING → ROUND_END → (next round or GAME_END)`.
- `deal(shuffledTiles)` — distributes 13 tiles to each player (14 to dealer), remaining tiles form the wall.
- Flower/season handling: if dealt a bonus tile, set it aside and draw replacement from wall end.
- Server persists live game state in Redis key `room:{code}:game`.
- Socket event: host emits `game:start` → server deals and emits `game:state` to each player (each player sees only their own hand + public info).

#### 2C — Table Layout & Live Hand
First-person mahjong table view and real-time hand broadcasting.

**Table layout (client UI):**
- One-point-perspective layout mimicking a real mahjong table with the current player seated at the bottom.
- **Bottom**: player's own hand, face-up, interactive (click to select, drag to reorder).
- **Left / Right**: side players' hands rendered as face-down tile rows, rotated 90° along the edges.
- **Top**: opposite player's face-down tile row across the top.
- **Center**: shared area for discard pool (populated in 2D) and wall counter.
- Each player's exposed melds and bonus tiles are displayed next to their hand.
- Player name, seat wind, and dealer badge shown at each position.
- Seat positions are relative to the viewer: the viewer is always at the bottom regardless of their actual seat wind.

**Live hand broadcast:**
- New socket events to relay cosmetic hand actions (no tile identities revealed):
  - `game:tileSelected` (C→S→C): broadcasts the index (position) of the selected tile to other players; they see a face-down tile rise.
  - `game:tileDeselected` (C→S→C): clears the selection.
  - `game:handReordered` (C→S→C): broadcasts that tiles at position X and Y were swapped; other players see face-down tiles animate into new positions.
- Server relays these events to other players in the room without modification. No game-state mutation — purely visual.
- Security: only positional indices are transmitted, never tile IDs or faces.

**Data model additions (`packages/common/src/types/events.ts`):**
- `game:tileSelected` payload: `{ seatIndex, tilePosition }`.
- `game:tileDeselected` payload: `{ seatIndex }`.
- `game:handReordered` payload: `{ seatIndex, fromPosition, toPosition }`.

#### 2D — Draw & Discard Loop
- Turn cycle: active player draws from wall → must discard one tile → turn passes to next player (E→S→W→N).
- Socket events: `game:draw` (S→C, tile drawn), `game:discard` (C→S, tile discarded), `game:state` (S→C, updated state after each action).
- Server validates all actions (can't discard a tile not in hand, can't act out of turn).
- Client: `DiscardPool` component (tiles discarded by each player, placed in center of table layout from 2C), `WallCounter` (remaining tiles). Click-to-discard on selected tile.
- Zustand `game-store.ts` for client game state (extends store from 2B/2C).

#### 2E — Claims
- After a discard, other players may claim: chow (吃, next-in-turn only, sequential pair in hand), pung (碰, any player, pair in hand), kong (杠, any player, triplet in hand).
- Claim priority: win > kong > pung > chow. Ties broken by turn proximity.
- Kong variants: concealed kong (4 in hand), exposed kong (claim discard), promoted kong (add to existing pung). After kong, draw replacement tile.
- Server: claim window with timeout (e.g., 5s). Collect all claims, resolve priority, execute winner.
- Socket events: `game:actionPrompt` (S→C, available actions for a player), `game:claim` (C→S, player's chosen action).
- Client: `ActionPrompt` component (buttons for available claims: skip / chow / pung / kong / win).

#### 2F — Win Detection
- `packages/common/src/rules.ts` — `isWinningHand(tiles, melds)` returns boolean.
- Valid patterns: standard (4 melds + 1 pair), seven pairs (七对), thirteen orphans (十三幺).
- Win sources: self-drawn (自摸, draw from wall), discard win (点炮, claim another's discard).
- Minimum 8-fan gate: a valid hand shape below 8 fan cannot be declared as a win.
- Server checks win validity on every `game:claim` with action `win`.

#### 2G — Scoring Engine
- `packages/common/src/scoring.ts` — `scoreFan(hand, melds, winCondition, seatWind, roundWind)` returns `{ patterns: FanPattern[], totalFan: number, points: number }`.
- All 81 fan patterns implemented and individually tested.
- Exclusion principle: higher patterns suppress overlapping lower patterns (e.g., 大四喜 excludes 三风刻).
- Point computation from total fan value.
- Test fixtures in `packages/common/src/__fixtures__/hands/` — one fixture per fan pattern.

#### 2H — Round & Game Flow
- Round-end: winner's score computed, point deltas applied to all four players (winner gains, others pay).
- Draw game (流局): wall exhausted with no winner — no score change, re-deal.
- Score display: `ScoreBoard` component shows fan breakdown, point deltas, running totals.
- Next round: rotate dealer (or keep if dealer wins), re-shuffle, re-deal.
- Wind rotation: after each full cycle of 4 hands, round wind advances (E→S→W→N).
- Game-end condition: configurable number of rounds (default: 1 full wind cycle = 4+ hands).
- Socket events: `game:roundEnd` (S→C, round results + fan breakdown), `game:end` (S→C, final standings).

#### 2I — Timeout & Reconnection
- Turn timer: configurable per-action timeout (e.g., 15s for discard, 5s for claims). Server auto-discards a random tile if player times out.
- Client: `TurnTimer` component showing countdown.
- Reconnection: if a player disconnects mid-game, their socket re-joins on reconnect. Server sends full `game:state` to the reconnected player. Game continues (timer still runs for disconnected player).
- Graceful degradation: if a player is disconnected for too long, auto-play (discard drawn tile) until they return.

### Phase 3 — Polish & Social
- WebRTC voice chat integration.
- Tile animations (draw, discard, claim).
- Sound effects.
- In-game text chat.
- Mobile-responsive layout.

### Phase 4 — Persistence & Stats
- PostgreSQL schema deployment.
- Save game results on game end.
- User profile page with stats.
- Leaderboard.

### Phase 5 — Robot Players
- Rule-based AI (defensive/offensive heuristics).
- Configurable difficulty levels.
- Fill empty seats automatically or on demand.

### Phase 6 — 破解版 (Cracked)
- Server computes tile probabilities from remaining hidden tiles.
- Probability overlay on client showing win chance per pattern.
- Performance optimization (compute on discard, cache results).

### Phase 7 — 技能版 (Skill)
- Skill card definitions and balance.
- Modified game engine to handle skill effects.
- UI for skill activation and visual effects.
